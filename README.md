### PORTFOLIO
## About me
My name is Olena Hlynska. For many years, I worked in the company for sales and implementation of software for design and technological preparation of production INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SAPR LLC as a sales specialist, performing duties from client search, software presentation, pre-sales preparation of all documentation to customer service. Due to the aggression against Ukraine, my field of activity experienced a crisis. For these reasons, I decided to master the QA Automated Testing specialty, which will give me the opportunity to stay in the IT field and perform work without geographical reference. I've been interested in this career before, but now with the chance to participate in the Dare IT Challenge: QA Automated Testing program, I've started to put it into practice by gaining hands-on experience in software testing. Thanks to my diverse experience in communicating with clients, I have developed interpersonal communication skills that help me work well in a team. I have a master's degree in aircraft management, worked at LTD RPI HARTRON-ARKOS, where I was involved in the development of a mathematical model of algorithms for the stabilization and control of the movement of aircraft, programming these processes in Fortran. I hope that my mathematical abilities will be useful to me in the further development of software testing.
